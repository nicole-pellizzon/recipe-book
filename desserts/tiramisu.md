Tiramisu recipe
Ingredients

    1 egg yolk
    1 tbsp caster sugar
    1 tsp vanilla sugar
    250 g mascarpone cheese
    175 ml strong black coffee
    1 tbsp coffee liqueur (Kahlua)
    10-12 Savoiardi biscuits
    1-2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder

Instructions

    Put the egg, sugar and vanilla sugar in a bowl and mix gently to a creamy consistency. Add the mascarpone and fold in to obtain a cream.
    Put the coffee in a bowl with the coffee liqueur. Dip the biscuits for a second or two in the coffee mixture, letting them absorb just enough to keep firm but not falling apart. Starting with biscuits, arrange in four individual dishes alternating layers of biscuit and mascarpone.
    Dust with cocoa powder and put into the fridge to set and chill.
